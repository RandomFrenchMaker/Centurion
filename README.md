# 🛡️ Project Centurion

**Centurion** is an open-source modular AI robot built to explore real-world autonomy, perception, and voice-based interaction — all powered by Raspberry Pi and affordable components.

---

### 🧠 Goals

- 🤖 Build a robot aware of its surroundings and functions
- 🗣️ Integrate LLM-based voice interaction (chat, orders, memory)
- 📡 Use ROS 2 and sensor fusion to generate real-time environment maps
- 🧩 Stay modular: every part can be improved, shared, and reused
- 📂 Open-source everything: software, hardware, docs

### 🔧 Status

✅ Project setup started — first prototype in progress
  - Legs have been printed and servos installed.
  - Structural chassis assembly underway.
🧪 Testing motion systems (servo-based leg)
  - Arduino Mega received but arrived damaged — a replacement has been ordered.
🖨️ Parts currently being 3D printed
  - Main body is being adapted and printed based on the open-source KYD0523 model (link in the links section).
📸 First video teaser planned for release
  - To be filmed once the prototype is assembled.
🧠 New hardware received
  - Jetson Orin Nano Super will handle vision and perception (ROS 2).
  - LIDAR 360° sensor received, integration in progress.
