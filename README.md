# 🛡️ Project Centurion

**Centurion** is an open-source modular AI robot built to explore real-world autonomy, perception, and voice-based interaction — all powered by Raspberry Pi and affordable components.

---

### 🧠 Goals

- 🤖 Build a robot aware of its surroundings and functions
- 🗣️ Integrate LLM-based voice interaction (chat, orders, memory)
- 📡 Use ROS 2 and sensor fusion to generate real-time environment maps
- 🧩 Stay modular: every part can be improved, shared, and reused
- 📂 Open-source everything: software, hardware, docs

---

### 🔧 Status

> ✅ Project setup started — first prototype in progress  
> 🧪 Testing motion systems (servo-based leg)  
> 🖨️ Parts currently being 3D printed  
> 📸 First video teaser planned for release
